# Warmup Assignment - Vector
See the specification for this OPTIONAL assignment in the companion pdf document.


Be sure to remove all non-relevant files from your repository before submitting your assignment. That is, include only your source code files and the makefile. Remove the specification and feel free to delete or modify this document. If you leave it, I will read it (as the name README implies).


To be able to run your program, open and edit the makefile (in a non-RTF text editing program, such as Sublime Text) and provide the appropriate sources to compile along with the executable name. Then run:

``` make all ```

If there are any errors, fix them in your source code, and rerun the make command. Repeat until there are no errors. Then you can run your program:

``` ./executable_name ```
